# Synesound App

The Synesound App is a unique multimedia application that uses synesthesia to create an immersive experience for the user. Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon where stimulation of one sense leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in another sense. In this app, the colors extracted from an uploaded image are used to generate animations, visual effects, and music, creating a synesthetic experience for the user.

Users can upload an image, which is then analyzed to extract the dominant colors and objects. The colors are used to create synchronized animations and visual effects that accompany the music. The result is a personalized audio-visual experience that is tailored to the specific colors of the user's uploaded image.

The app requires of an active Spotify session on your computer.
